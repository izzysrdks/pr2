# Info550Project  
  
 For this project, I am combining three datasets in order to run a regression to assess if the engagement of a student in yoga practice affects their TNF alpha levels.  
   
 To begin, fork the repo and clone onto your local device. From the command line, move into the folder contianing all documents from this repo. Once in the working directory, run `make ` from the command line.
 
 # Other helpful tips
 
 Run `make help` to see details about each step of the project.  
 The final report will be outputed as an html file titled `report.html`.

# Execute the code  

To execute the code you can run `make` from the command line while in the working directory with the datasets and the code.  


This will create a file in the folder with the code called `Report.html` containing the results.
